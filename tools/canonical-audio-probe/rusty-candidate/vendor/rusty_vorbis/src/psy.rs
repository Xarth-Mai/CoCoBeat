//! Psychoacoustic model (brick 5): a masking threshold used as the floor-1 target.
//!
//! The floor is the perceptual noise floor — quantization noise sitting at the floor is
//! ~inaudible. So instead of an energy envelope (brick 3), the floor tracks a **masking
//! threshold**: per-Bark-band energy, spread across bands (a loud tone masks its neighbours),
//! sat a tonality-dependent ratio below the spread signal, and floored at a per-frame noise
//! floor. `quality` (0 = low, 1 = high) shifts the whole threshold — lower threshold → more
//! of the spectrum rises above the floor → more residue bits → higher quality.

/// Env-tunable psychoacoustic parameters, loaded once. Defaults reproduce the shipped model, so
/// an unset environment is a no-op; the `VORBIS_*` overrides drive PEAQ-gated A/B tuning.
